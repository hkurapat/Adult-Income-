## Welcome!

I’m Harshil Kurapati, a rising senior in high school with a deep interest in data science. This project is part of my exploration into how race and gender impact income levels. You can explore more of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/hkurapat) or contact me via [email](mailto:ckurapat@gmail.com).

### Project Overview

This analysis delves into the demographic factors influencing income, utilizing a Bayesian Regression Model. The full project code and documentation are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hkurapat/income-prediction).

### Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of [Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/), where I've honed my skills in data analysis and visualization.
