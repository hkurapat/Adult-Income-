## Model Overview

In this section, we present the details of the Bayesian Regression Model used to analyze the impact of race and gender on income levels. We fit the model using the `brms` package and provide the parameter estimates along with their confidence intervals.

## Mathematical Formulation

The model uses a logistic regression framework to predict the probability \( \pi_i \) of income being above 50K. The logistic function is given by:

\[
\pi_i = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-( \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Race}_i + \beta_2 \text{Sex}_i )\right)}
\]

where:
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept,
- \( \beta_1 \) is the coefficient for race,
- \( \beta_2 \) is the coefficient for sex.

## Fitting the Model

The Bayesian Regression Model was fitted using the `brms` package with the following code:
