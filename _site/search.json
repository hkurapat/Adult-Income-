This dataset includes demographic information and income levels for adults in the United States. It was originally extracted from the 1994 Census database.\n\n\nDataset Details\n\nTitle: Adult Census Income\nSource: Kaggle\nLink: Adult Census Income Dataset on Kaggle\nDescription: The dataset includes the following variables: age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, hours per week, native country, and income level. The primary goal is to predict whether an individual’s income exceeds $50K per year based on these attributes.\nUsage: This dataset was used to explore the impact of race and gender on income and to build predictive models to estimate income levels.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning and Preparation\nThe data cleaning process involved the following steps: 1. Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset were handled appropriately. Missing categorical data were filled using the most frequent value, while missing numerical data were filled using the median value. 2. Removing Outliers: Outliers in numerical variables were identified and removed to ensure a robust analysis. 3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were encoded using appropriate techniques such as one-hot encoding for nominal variables and ordinal encoding for ordinal variables. 4. Feature Engineering: New features were created based on existing variables to enhance the predictive power of the models. 5. Splitting the Data: The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the predictive models.\n\n\nObservations Removed\nDuring the data cleaning process, observations with missing values that could not be imputed were removed. Additionally, observations identified as outliers were removed to ensure the robustness of the analysis.\n\n\nCitation\nIf you use this dataset in your work, please cite it as follows:\nBansal, Lovish. “Adult Census Income.” Kaggle, 2020. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lovishbansal123/adult-census-income."
